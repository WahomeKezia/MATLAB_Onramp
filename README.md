You can learn a lot about a star even though it may be 1000 light years away , by examining the light that came from it . Using a diffraction gradient you can split a beam of light into it's individual wavelengths, just like water droplets splitting sunlight into a rainbow.

Measuring the intensity of light observed at each wavelenght gives the stars a characteristic spectrum.

In this project, I will work on a practice activity from Matlab Onramp course , Using Matlab to find the observed wavelenght of hydrogen alpha line of  **HD94028** , a faint star in the constellation of Leo , to compare it to the know wavelength of hydrogen absorption to determine how fast the star is moving away from Earth. With precise spectral measurements over time , astronomers use this technique to discover the slight oscllications that demaostrate the presence of planets.

is movignin relation to earth , 
To do this we wiil be inspecting the spectrum of **HD94028**

In this spectrum , not the deep spike  in the spectrum , which means not much light is radiated at this particular wavelength around 650 nanametres . This is a common future  of many stars because Hydrogen , a major component of most stars, absorbs light at precisely 656.3 nanometres 

However on a closer look up ,  this spike in **HD94028's** spectrum ,  hydrogen alpha line occurs at a slightly longer wavelength than 656.3 nanometres .

This is because the star is moving aways from the earth , just like a sound emitting object becomes higher as it comes towards you and lowers as it moves away , a star  spectrum is blue shifted , that is shifted to shorter wavelenghts if it;s moving toward the you , redshifted to longer wavelengths if it's moving  away.
