You can learn a lot about a star even though it may be 1000 light years away , by examining the light that came from it . Using a diffraction gradient you can split a beam of light into it's individual wavelengths, just like water droplets splitting sunlight into a rainbow.

Measuring the intensity of light observed at each wavelenght gives the stars a characteristic spectrum.

In this repo, I will work on a practice activity from Matlab Onramp course , to determine of  a star , HD94028 , a faint star in the constellation of Leo
